## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python-based keylogger for Windows. It captures keystrokes, logs them to a hidden temporary file, and periodically emails the log using a Gmail account and app password.

This tool demonstrates concepts like keyboard event listening, file handling, and secure email transmission in Python.

---

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes made on the system.
- Stores key logs in a hidden file in a random temp directory.
- Periodically emails logs to a specified address via Gmailâ€™s SMTP server.
- Script obfuscation via base64 strings.
- Runs silently (without visible console window).

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your Windows machine.
- **pip** to install Python packages.

### Required Python Libraries

pip install pynput

### 2. (Optional) If converting to .exe, install PyInstaller


---

## Gmail App Password Setup

*Due to Google security features, you must use a Gmail app password (not your main password).*

1. Go to your [Google Account Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** if not already turned on.
3. Go to the **App passwords** section.
4. Choose **Mail** as the app, and **Windows Computer** for the device.
5. Generate and copy the 16-character password.
6. You will use this password in the script.

*Never share or publish your app password!*

---

## Configuration

Edit the following values in `keylogger.py`:


**Change:**  
- `sender` to your Gmail address  
- `receiver` to the address that should receive logs  
- `auth` to your Gmail app password

---

## Usage

### Run the script


- The script captures keystrokes in the background and sends them at set intervals (default: ~8 minutes).
- By default, the window is hidden (no visible console).
- To stop: open Task Manager and terminate the Python process.

---

### Build a Windows Executable (.exe)

You can run without needing Python installed on target machines.

1. In your project folder, run:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed keylogger.py


2. The resulting `.exe` will appear in the `dist` subfolder.
3. Double-click the `.exe` to run it (it runs silently).
4. **Note:** Most antivirus software will flag and potentially block/delete keylogger executables for security reasons.

---

## Customization

- **Change log email interval:**  
  Edit the second argument in the `time.sleep()` call in the script.  
  E.g., `time.sleep(300)` for 5 minutes.

- **Change log file location/obfuscation:**  
  Adjust file path/code if more advanced stealth is needed (for learning purposes only).
